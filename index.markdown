My research involves a mix of psychometric modeling and the experimentation/modeling that arises from cognitive science and mathematical psychology. Specific research interests include

- Bayesian latent variable models

- Forecasting and subjective probability: Aggregation, evaluation, crowdsourcing/wisdom of crowds

- Psychometric measurement: Test/item bias and fairness

- Statistical modeling: Estimation, selection, software<br/><br/>


I have published a lot of papers in good journals and have been involved in some big-time grants, and my code can be found in some beloved R packages. For papers, see the link at top. You might also look at:
